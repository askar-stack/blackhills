# blackhills

The purpose of this project was to use the MJML framework to convert a blog post to an HTML email.

All the content for the email can be found here: https://www.blackhillsenergy.com/blog/7-ways-to-celebrate-earth-day-every-day

The layout is simple as it was my first time using this framework. As I get more familiar with this, I intend to incorporate different designs.

The great thing about MJML is that I do not have to worry about how this email would look in different clients!
